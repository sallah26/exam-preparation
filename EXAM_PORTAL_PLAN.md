# 🎓 Exam Portal Implementation Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

Dynamic exam preparation portal with hierarchical content management and student access.

**System Flow:**

1. Admin creates exam types (e.g., CoC Exam, Institutional Exam)
2. Each exam type can have multiple departments (dynamically created)
3. Each department can have multiple years/semesters (flexible naming)
4. Under each year/semester, admin adds study materials (documents or questions)
5. Students navigate: Exam Type → Department → Year/Semester → Materials

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Core Models**

```sql
exam_types
├── id, name, description, created_at, updated_at

departments
├── id, name, exam_type_id (FK), created_at, updated_at

academic_periods
├── id, name, department_id (FK), created_at, updated_at

materials
├── id, title, type (DOCUMENT|QUESTION), academic_period_id (FK)
├── created_at, updated_at

documents
├── id, material_id (FK), file_path, file_type, original_name

questions
├── id, material_id (FK), question_text

question_options
├── id, question_id (FK), option_text, is_correct
```

### **Relationships**

- ExamType (1) → (Many) Department
- Department (1) → (Many) AcademicPeriod
- AcademicPeriod (1) → (Many) Material
- Material (1) → (1) Document OR (Many) Question
- Question (1) → (Many) QuestionOption

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### **Admin Routes** (Protected: `/api/admin/exam/*`)

## 🎨 Frontend Structure

### **Route Planning**

#### **Admin Routes** (Protected: `/dashboard/*`)

```
/dashboard/exam-types           # Manage exam types
/dashboard/departments          # Manage departments
/dashboard/academic-periods     # Manage periods
/dashboard/materials           # Manage materials
/dashboard/upload              # File upload interface
/dashboard/questions           # Question management
```

#### **Student Routes** (Public)

```
/                              # Home page with exam types
/exam-types/[id]              # Show departments
/departments/[id]             # Show academic periods
/periods/[id]                 # Show materials
/materials/[id]               # View document or questions
```

## 📁 File Management

### **Storage Strategy**

- **Development**: Local storage in `/backend/uploads/`
- **File Types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Size Limit**: 10MB per file
- **Naming**: `${timestamp}-${originalname}`
- **Serving**: Express static middleware

### **File Upload Flow**

1. Admin selects material type (DOCUMENT)
2. Uploads file via admin interface
3. File stored locally with unique name
4. Document record created in database
5. Students access via public URL

---

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### **Access Control**

- **Admin Routes**: JWT authentication required
- **Student Routes**: Public access (no auth)
- **File Access**: Public serving for documents
- **Upload Security**: File type validation, size limits

### **Data Validation**

- File type restrictions
- Required field validation
- Unique constraints (exam type names)
- Relationship integrity (foreign keys)

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **API Testing**

```bash
# Create exam type
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/exam/exam-types \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"name": "CoC Exam", "description": "Certificate of Competency"}'

# Get exam types (public)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/student/exam-types
```

### **File Upload Testing**

```bash
# Upload document
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/exam/materials/:materialId/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "document=@sample.pdf"
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### **Environment Variables**

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/hayu_fullstack_db"

# JWT
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="your_secure_secret"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your_secure_secret"

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **Production Considerations**

- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] File upload to cloud storage (AWS S3)
- [ ] CDN for file serving
- [ ] Rate limiting on upload endpoints
- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] Error monitoring
